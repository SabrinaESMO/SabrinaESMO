### ðŸ“šðŸŽ® ABOUT ME ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š ###

I love reading, especially "romantasy" books like ACOTAR or Caraval. I cannot live without a world where I can dive in every now and then to live some adventures.

I also love freestyle slalom, true crime, writing, painting, and trying new activities in general. 


>[!NOTE]
>I'm not really active on social media, but you can find me in [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/leyendoazul/) talking about books from time to time.
