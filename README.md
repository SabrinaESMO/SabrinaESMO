### ðŸ“šðŸŽ® ABOUT ME ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š ###

I love reading, especially "romantasy" books like ACOTAR or Caraval. I cannot live without a world where to dive in every now and then to live some adventures.

I also love writting, painting, singing, and trying new activities. Rigth now I'm about to start diving in D&D's world. 


>[!NOTE]
>I'm not really active on social media, but you can find me in [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/leyendoazul/) talking about books from time to time,
>or in [X](https://twitter.com/LeyendoAzul) very less often.
